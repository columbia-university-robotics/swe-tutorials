# Tutorials for CURC Software Engineers


A Comprehensive List of Tutorials for New Software Engineers Joining CURC


## Welcome
Thanks for joining CURC's software engineering team. At CURC, we use the robotics middle-ware called ROS (robot operating system) for our software infrastructure. To contribute to our repos, it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of ROS. You might be unfamiliar with ROS until now or need a refresher. This page contains some very helpful resources for learning ROS. Don't worry, if you are stuck or needs help, you can always reach out to Jonathan or Neil via email or Slack.
